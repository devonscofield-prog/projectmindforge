Awesome, man. Well, I'm gonna shoot over that calendar invite. It should be loaded in your inbox any second now. 
If you don't mind, could you go check that? Just to make sure it all works out, it'll. You know how emails are. Sometimes they don't want to work correctly, so I just want to I just.
Speaker 9 | 34:41
Yeah, sometimes they don't want to work, sometimes they go to a spam.
caleb.thompson | 34:45
Yeah, who knows, dude?
Speaker 9 | 34:46
Hasn't showed up yet, but give it a minute.
caleb.thompson | 34:48
Yeah, sometimes it takes a second.
Speaker 9 | 34:48
That's probably took a wrong term getting here.
caleb.thompson | 34:49
Yeah, well, while that's in nos, while that's loading in there, man, is there any specific cloud environments that you get your hands on day to day that. I could let my learning director know. Just to cover on the call. 
Kind of. To show how we could help you in that area for sure.
Speaker 9 | 35:02
Well, the cloud is. I mean, most of our servers have moved up to the cloud. There's probably maybe 10% of all the servers we used to have are left over. Not in the cloud, but it's, that's I can't I don't do a lot of stuff for the cloud myself. What I do.
caleb.thompson | 35:19
And you said for sure, okay.
Speaker 9 | 35:19
I mean, outside of accessing the information, it's most of my stuff's networking, so, nothing I can think of.
caleb.thompson | 35:25
Yeah, definitely, yeah.
Speaker 9 | 35:28
I'll poke around and see if anybody can tell me what's, any problems they've or training they need in the cloud, and, I'll be ready on Wednesday.
caleb.thompson | 35:37
With networking, we offer a wide range of things from, you know, Cisco and firewalls and all the things, so we could definitely cover that on the call as well.
Speaker 9 | 35:47
Okay, let's see, still nothing here yet.
caleb.thompson | 35:50
Do not load it in there.
Speaker 9 | 35:53
I'm watching for it, checking the spam box, nothing there.
caleb.thompson | 35:54
Yeah, man, sometimes maybe yeah, you know how you found it.
Speaker 9 | 36:00
Well, a lot of. No, I was just saying there's a lot of junk in the spambox, but, not nothing from you.
caleb.thompson | 36:04
Okay, yeah, you know how this works.
Speaker 9 | 36:07
I just clean it all out, so that's fine.
caleb.thompson | 36:10
But I was thinking maybe sometimes a firewall catches it, and it just won't. It has to, like, get access to that. 
But you know how that works. You're in the networking world. I don't have to tell you that.
Speaker 9 | 36:22
All right. I'll. I'll. As soon as I get it, I'll. I'll, reply, I'll answer yes on it.
caleb.thompson | 36:27
Okay, man. Yeah, that's awesome. And I'll probably sot you a call like an hour or so before that meeting just to keep it on the front of your mi. 
It's always helpful. 
And so, yeah, Michael, man, are you on a team over there?
Speaker 9 | 36:35
All right, you got it on my team, the networking team.
caleb.thompson | 36:41
Awesome, man, if you can't, you have the full freedom to loop in anybody to the squad that you would like just to get some information for them, and awesome.
Speaker 9 | 36:48
Okay, I'll see if everybody's it handy five.
caleb.thompson | 36:50
What does that team look like? How big is the team?

Well, how's your morning going? Good, what's the purpose of the call to help out?
caleb.thompson | 01:31:28
Yeah, for sure. This is Caleb with Storm Studios. I chatted with Brian earlier this week, and we have, we just have a meeting regarding, live instructor at IT training today in about an hour from now. 
And so I'll just call in just to remind him. Keep it on the front of his mind, hoping that everything still works out.
Speaker 6 | 01:31:47
What's the purpose of the call? Like, what's the end game? What's the objective? Where's the goal? Line? Where's the touchdown? Where's the basket?
caleb.thompson | 01:31:54
I hear you.
Speaker 6 | 01:31:55
What's the ultimate goal here?
caleb.thompson | 01:31:57
Yeah, so basically, we do the live instructor at IT training at Storm Wind Studios. And really my purpose for my call right now is, just to remind. It's just a reminder call that we got that meeting coming up. It'll be with my learning director, who has a lot more information, and so it'll be more in depth on all of the things that we can do. It, you know, we do everything from, Windows to networking to all the different cloud environments. We have different ranges that we use, release and release a new customizable pricing structure as well. 
So it's a little more unique. And. You know, when I chat O'Brien last time, he said he was interested. And we got it on the schedule for today. And so the touchdown for me would be for him to be there today. 
And just for that to go wellm.
Speaker 6 | 01:32:44
Okay, well, that's pretty clear. Brian's pretty solid. If he scheduled time with you and you've got his e mail and he confirmed your meeting, he's solid, so.
caleb.thompson | 01:32:54
[Laughter] Yes, sir.
Speaker 6 | 01:32:57

And so that was this guy's partner who has a media or partner in business, not like real life partner. And, he was just like he's like, hello, this is Dave or whatever his name was. And he's like, what's the purpose of your call? I was like, blah, Brian. He's like, I got you, b like, what's the in go like touchdown? 
Like, what do you think? Like fill goal? Like, what's the goal? What's the purpose of the call? Where are you hoping to be? And I was like, well, I mean, I talked to him last week.

This was just. 
Great question.

[Laughter]. 
Di? 
Hey, is this Megan?
Speaker 8 | 01:50:41
This is she.
caleb.thompson | 01:50:42
Hey, Megan, this is Caleb with Storm Studios open. That name sounded familiar to you?
Speaker 8 | 01:50:49
Somewhat. I apologize.
caleb.thompson | 01:50:51
No worries at all. 
So, we do live instructor light IT training over here. Does that kind of help at all?
Speaker 8 | 01:50:59
Kind of, yeah, to.
caleb.thompson | 01:51:00
A little bit. Yeah, no worries. Yeah. So, yeah, it was really. It looks like we've chatted in the past a little bit, and, the real reason for my call. I was. I was hoping to reconnect to you, Megan. 
Because over at Stormline, we. We've recently expanded our core softwering pretty greatly and released a number of new ranges as well. Built out a brand new customizable pricing structure. So pricing is a little more unique to you. 
And basically, we have ranges from cybersecurity to networking to Windows. It just has a little refresher. We what we do is we pair those tools with short lessons, you know, three to five minutes each. 
So getting certified and upscaling for you and your team is it's very simple and easy. With us, we try to make it as just intentional. And you get the most out of it out of every second that you put in. 
And so we offer one on one mentorship with our instructors, which is pretty unique to us. I was just hoping to reconnect. Maybe carve out five to ten minutes of your schedule. Just to show you some. Share with you some new updates and features that we got going on. 
Maybe I know this week's gonna tune in, maybe next week.
Speaker 8 | 01:51:58
I remember I did I do remember now. Apologies for forgetting. But no, I did do that five to ten and I saw that it wasn't going to work out for me at that time, so I do appreciate the call though.
caleb.thompson | 01:52:07
Okay, for sure. Yeah, I guess I did. See, the last time we chatted, the real reason for my call is because we have really updated a lot. We basically kind of revamped our platform. And I would see in. 
And our pricing structure is different. So it's pretty. It's significantly different since the last time we've chat it. And, I was maybe hoping to.
Speaker 8 | 01:52:26
Yeah, ca I don't wanna.
caleb.thompson | 01:52:28
No, you're all good.
Speaker 8 | 01:52:28
Sorry, go ahead. I know one of the things that was a lot of the live courses or so were during the daytime, which I wouldn't be able to attend, so I was not interested for that.
caleb.thompson | 01:52:43
I see. Yeah, for sure. I will say they so they are recorded as well. And so once it's recorded and the live session happened, you do have access to it, and you have access to our instructors, and so they'll be there for you to kind of you can reach out to them whenever you need to. 
And so in a sense, you can really work it however you want to and whenever you want to. And we just released new microbytes, so, you know, it's pretty simple and easy to learn. 
So it is really on your own time. 
And if it is, you know, convenient for you, those live sessions are during the day, like you said, but definitely the instructors are always available for your help.
Speaker 8 | 01:53:16
Yeah, no, I understand, I appreciate it, but I am good for time being, so thank you so much.
caleb.thompson | 01:53:22
Okay, yeah, that knows.
Speaker 8 | 01:53:24
I really hope you have a day though.
caleb.thompson | 01:53:24
Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 8 | 01:53:25
And enjoy your Friday.
caleb.thompson | 01:53:25

Eight possible shows today, so who knows all no, dude, it's been like this is like nine days actually working your quota doesn't really start. No, yeah, it won't, so I'm not I'm definitely not gonna hit quota for show. Actually, no, I will hit quota for shows 'cause it's only ten for us. 
And then it's like, I don't think I'm gonna hit quota for pipeline, but I hit quota for. I know I got revenue. Doesn't matter. Like by December I had like 27 shows, 560 pipe that a huge. What was that with was it just a bigger company or. No, it was just like twelve people. The one of the reps I set for are like keys sort of new horizons. 
And that's like it's like K Lin my he charge like 1400 a license. Really? So do that a I think it' fat one of Canadians that's how I'm getting a lot of French. I just got a sal cool they'll fucking they'll hear you.

It's going to be four shows. My. She got. Get another set room. 
So funny. That's what that does. I might have to accept my defeat right now. There. 
She's getting another one right now too. So. Dang. 
[Laughter] I mean. It's a best way, Martin. 
And I mean, we were just another day right now, trying to make a day a good day or just try to make float out of anything, right? 
So I was like, you know, the next. So I was talking to, like, don't need the dire shot. And this guy was like, hey, is this G? No. 
Doesn't what did you ever figure out anything last night for Jonah what ended up happening with Jonah you fun really? And then coming back and then we apparently he's like, done this in the past where basically, he just, like, refuses to work. 
So that's why I figured that's like, you know, so he could have, like, stayed at, like, I help, which is, like, hard to get into. And he just, like, didn't want to work. And so, like, at the same point. 
Like it's like nineteen years old, his like family's from Uganda. Well, like, he has a hard I know he has a hard life. He got adopted. They treated I talked to his he was like over there orphan and Uganda. I feel like his adoptive parents, he said that they treated them terribly, but it's I'm like it's so hard for me in the situation's broke because I'm like, you want to believe everything I do. 
It's just hard to. Like my hope. Is that your camp? Like realistically, he's never going to experience a vacation any time. So. So you might as well enjoy have weekend deal to be poured into and get like life right before Christ. 
And then, like, hopefully, like, we're praying like, not a lazy spirit like, you know, and just like stuff like that. 
And give him the resources. And it's kind of up to him at that point, you know? So, yeah, we'll see, because I. 
Yeah, because I ended up me and Sam sat with him, and he was like. I mean, he was worshiping like. There's just another day heed at Christ church and he's like, yeah, I got the situation, and life was like, is it? Jona? Know what? I did. 
This before. Yeah, that's kind of what I like. I hate to say that, but I kind of thought that just. Yeah, I don't want to say any bad, but he could work like. Hey, like what he want pra for? 
And he wasn't over circumstances like I he has to walk everywhere. Like, I don't have a home. He wasn't bringing me that. He said, I want prayer, like for my relationship with, like, my MoM and dad. That's what he said to us as well. 
And it's like, to me, I would cry because I was just like, you know, that's what's the priorities. Yeah, which you like, he just never had the, like literally like, he never had the like, the love, like, he just this least from what he says. 
And so, like, it's hard. It's hard to just be like bra should, like, work. Yeah, because if you're not raised in, are you supposed to know he's eight? Yeah, he was a well, ca yeah, he was a but even then, like, that's I guess. 
I mean, by the time you're eight years old, you learn a lot of things about how to live, and so, I don't know, it's interesting, but I hope that it. I hope it works out for us. There's only so much you can do. Where it'sresed. 
Like? [Laughter] Yeah true. 
Yo, I can't open it is a freaking is that Donald Trump. That's insane. That's insane. That's good.
